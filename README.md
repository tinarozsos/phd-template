## About

This is a template for information management during a PhD.
The goal of this template is to create a searchable, structured, and comprehensive documentation of all aspects of a PhD.
The internal setup handles the organization of multiple research projects, meeting notes, references, conference attendance, research funding, and more.

All defaults can be modified, therefore the template is suitable for organizing any other long-term project with a lot of accumulated information.

## Template setup

1. Make sure your preferred R IDE ([Positron](https://positron.posit.co/download.html), [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) are installed
2. Click the "Use this template" button at the top of this repository to create a copy of this repository in your own GitHub account
3. Clone the repository to your local machine and open the project in your R IDE

**Required packages:** `tidyverse`, `knitr`, (`grDevices`, `praise`, `cli`, `utils`)* 
*The last four packages are only required for the custom console message on start, and can be removed if you don't want to use that feature.

## Template use

The template is organized as a website, with a home page, a navigation bar, and various subpages.
The navigation bar includes a search button that allows you to search for any content across the website.

In terms of repository structure, the `.qmd` files follow the structure of the compiled site.
In addition, `_quarto.yml`, `templates.R`, `.Rprofile`, and the files in the `_extensions` folder define the internal working of the template.

### Practical overview

The overview page is defined in `index.qmd`.
It is meant to provide both a short-term and long-term perspective.

1. Quick TO-DOs: a quick list of immediate to-dos (e.g. tasks for the day)
2. Timeline: a graphical overview of the timeline of the PhD to keep track of long-run goals
    - The deadlines and periods appearing in the timeline are defined in a `tribble()` in `index.qmd`. The figure, generated with `ggplot2`, is automatically updated based on the input data.
    - Vertical spacing can be adjusted by changing the `fig.height` argument of the code chunk.

## Customizing the template

-   edit `_quarto.yml` to change:
    -   website title
    -   navigation bars
    -   website format and theme
    -   any other available [Website Options](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/websites.html)
- edit `.Rprofile` to change:
    -   if `templates.R` is automatically sourced on start
    -   the custom console startup message
- edit `templates.R` to change:
    -   the `idea` snippets generated by calling `idea()`
    -   the reference pages generated by calling `add_ref(zkey)` 
- edit `_extensions/meeting-template.qmd` to change the page generated by calling `meeting()`
- edit `_extensions/paper-template.qmd` to change the page generated by calling `paper()`

- The original idea and initial setup of this template was based on Cynthia Huang's [Quarto Wiki Template](https://github.com/cynthiahqy/quarto-wiki-template), introduced in the posit::conf(2024) talk [Quarto for Knowledge Management](https://github.com/cynthiahqy/positconf2024).
- The idea for the template pages and page snippets was inspired by Emily Riederer's post on [Internal R packages](https://www.emilyriederer.com/post/team-of-packages/).
- The custom console message on start is a modified version of the one appearing in Dr. Mowinckel's [Customise your R startup message](http://drmowinckels.io/blog/2024/rproject/) blog post.
